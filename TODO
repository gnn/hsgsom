general:
  - remember to check out
  http://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2007/05/27/snapshotting-a-neat-problem-and-solution-in-haskell/
    could be helpfull

  - try to express the type Node rather as type Maybe Node because otherwise
    I'm just constantly reinventing the Maybe wheel with Leaf as Nothing.

tests.hs:
  - add test to check whether normlize acs as id on inputs which are already 
    between 0 and 1 and which have active bounds 
    (NOTE: this is different from normlize/idempotent)
    
  -add tests for distance and bmu
