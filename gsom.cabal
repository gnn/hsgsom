Synopsis:           An implementation of the GSOM clustering algorithm.
Description:
  The growing self organising map (GSOM) algorithm is a clustering algorithm
  working on a set of n-dimensional numeric input vectors. It's output is a 
  network of nodes laid out in two dimensions where each node has a weight 
  vector associated with it. This weight vector has the same dimension as the 
  input vectors and is meant to be intepreted as a cluster center, i.e. it 
  represents those input vectors whose distance to the node's weight vector
  is minimal when compared to the distance to the other nodes weight vectors.
  See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSOM> for an explanation of the algorithm.
  The algorithm was introduced in:
