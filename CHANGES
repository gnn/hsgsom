Changes in version 0.2.0

  * Bump required Cabal version

  * Add this changelog file

  * Make *.hs files start with an uppercase letter.

  * Add the experimental 'Parallel' module, exposing a parallelized
    version of the algorithm.
    *BEWARE*: This is likely to contain bugs or exhibit strange
    behaviour. Work in progress.

  * Resolve ties between nodes with same distance in BMU calculation
    like in the reference implementation and paper (boundary nodes are
    preferred).

  * New type: 'Config'; a clunky everything bucket for phase parameters

  * API change: 'vent' now also returns spawned nodes

  * API addition: add function 'boundaryNode'; checks whether a node is
    on the boundary

  * API addition: export function 'growthThreshold'; was private to
    'Phase' module; is now needed by the 'Parallel' module

  * API addition: 'dumpInputs' and 'renderScript' functions; they are
    hacky and likely to change, but maybe they are useful

  * Fix (major): single-threaded 'phase' implementation now responds to
    the spread factor. I have no idea where that regression came from
    and hope it is fixed now.

  * Fix (minor): passes now reach maximum step size.

  * Fix (minor): haddock clarification, grammar, typo and link fixes

  * Fix (minor): act more closely to the reference implementation when
    new nodes are created

  * Fix (minor): error is not propagated back to the node from which it
    originated

  * Fix (minor): weight vector calculation of new nodes now actually
    acts as documented
